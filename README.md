<b>Stable Roommate Matching in a Hostel</b>

This project aims to find the most stable pairings of roommates within a hostel using the Gale-Shapley algorithm. The objective is to create fair and stable matches between students based on their preferences.

<b>Problem Statement</b>

Finding the right roommate can be challenging, especially in a hostel where preferences, personalities, and academic performance can vary. This project addresses the problem by dividing students into two groups based on their academic performance and matching them according to their preferences.

<b>Objective</b>

<b>Divide Students:</b> Group 1 includes students with grades above 9, while Group 2 includes students with grades below 9.<br>

<b>Rank Preferences:</b> Each student ranks the opposite group members in order of preference.<br>

<b>Achieve Stable Matching:</b> A match is considered stable if no two students prefer each other over their assigned roommates. The <b>Gale-Shapley algorithm</b> is used to ensure stable and fair matches.

<b>Features</b>

<b>Roommate Matching:</b> Efficiently pairs students into stable roommate pairs using the renowned Gale-Shapley algorithm.<br>

<b>User-Friendly Interface:</b> Developed using Django to provide a smooth and interactive web experience.<br>

<b>Preference Input:</b> Allows students to input and rank their preferences easily through the web interface.<br>


<b>Automated Matching:</b> The system processes preferences and generates stable matches without manual intervention.

<b>Technologies Used</b>

<b>Django:</b> Web framework used for building the application.<br>

<b>Gale-Shapley Algorithm:</b> The core algorithm used for stable matching.<br>

<b>HTML/CSS/JavaScript:</b> For building the user interface.<br>

<b>Motivation</b>

This project simplifies the roommate matching process in hostels, ensuring stability and reducing conflicts by using a data-driven approach. The Gale-Shapley algorithm guarantees that the matchings are stable, meaning no two students would prefer to be with each other over their assigned roommates.

<b>Further Scope</b>

<b>Real-time Matching:</b> Allowing for continuous updates to preferences.<br>

<b>Enhanced Grouping:</b> Incorporating more factors beyond grades to refine the matching process.<br>

<b>Mobile App Integration:</b> Expanding the project to mobile platforms for greater accessibility.
