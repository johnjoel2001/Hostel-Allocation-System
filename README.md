The main objective of this project is to find the best stable pair of roommates in a hostel.
It involves a process in which we will divide the hostellers into two groups. 
The first group will comprise of students who have got grades above 9 and the other will comprise of students who have got grades below 9.
Each student is made to rank the members of the opposite group in order of preferences. The matching is said to be stable if there are no two roommates who prefer each other to their roommates under the matching. The gale-Shapley algorithm, which is well renowned, is used for matching between the two groups of hostellers.
I had built a website for this using Django
